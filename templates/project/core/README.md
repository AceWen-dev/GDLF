# Core

Layer 2: project source code.

models/       # architecture builders
losses/       # loss builders

task.py       # composition root
runtime.py    # policy / runner wiring
commands/     # train / eval / sweep (core entries only)
tools/        # generic maintenance utilities
tests/        # tests for this project
```

Reusable logic lives here; the sibling `scripts/` directory stays thin. If code
is reusable across projects, move it to DLEF core/adapters instead.
